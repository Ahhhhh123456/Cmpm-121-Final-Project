# Cmpm-121-Final-Project


**Tools Lead (Max):** They will research alternative tools, identify good ones, and help every other team member set them up on their own machine in the best configuration for your project. This person might also establish your team’s coding style guidelines and help peers setup auto-formatting systems. This person should provide support for systems like source control and automated deployment (if appropriate to your team’s approach).


**Engine Lead (Jason):** They will research alternative engines, get buy-in from teammates on the choice, and teach peers how to use it if it is new to them. This might involve making small code examples outside of the main game project to teach others. The Engine Lead should also establish standards for which kinds of code should be organized into which folders of the project. They should try to propose software designs that insulate the rest of the team from many details of the underlying engine.


**Design Lead (Elton):** They will be responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game. They might make small art or code samples for others to help them contribute and maintain game content. Where the project might involve a domain-specific language, the Design Lead (who is still an engineer in this class) will lead the discussion as to what primitive elements the language needs to provide.

# Tools and Materials


The engine that we plan on using is a phaser. At first, we were fine with whatever but we ended up with phaser. The main reason why we decided to choose the phaser is because we are somewhat familiar with it as CMPM 120 taught us how a phaser works which would make it feasible to make something with the given time constraints.



We plan on using JSON and Javascript as Phaser already supports the programming and data languages. As it stands there might be an off chance that we’ll use another data language but we’re most likely going to stick with JSON.


The tool we plan on using is Github (of course) to work on the project. We will also use whatever IDE the three of us prefer to use. As for making the game assets, we could make our own or use free ones on the internet while making sure to credit them. A possible one that we would use is possibly Kenny Assets. 


For our alternate platform choice, we would use typescript. The reason why is that it was an example given in the lecture and typescript is something we used all quarter so it would most likely be easier on us when we have to convert our game. 



# Outlook


One of the main challenges we see for this project is the fact multiple people with different code styles. The topics we have learned in this class will definitely help with this but we are still apprehensive since most of the coding we have done has been as individuals. This is also our main focus on this project, to maintain a consistent code style across the whole project so we can all understand what is happening in the game itself. This will prepare us to work with anyone in the industry, and potentially teach us how to change our own code style or at least tweak it to match other people’s code styles. The main focus for us will be teamwork and making sure everyone can work efficiently and consistently, this will enable us to make a fun and interactive game without a lot of the pain and suffering that come with debugging. There will still be a focus on making the game fun and entertaining, however, similar to the class, the main focus will be on code style and code smells. We might also try to find a way to support controllers within our game as it will help people that are unable to use keyboard and mouse due to limitations with their body
